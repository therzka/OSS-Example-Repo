# The CONTRIBUTING File

This file should provide a complete guide to contributing to your project. It may or may not also contain a Code of Conduct for the project (in this repo we've included it separately in a [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file).  The goal is to encourage contributions and make new contributors feel welcome, so the tone should be friendly and instructions should be thorough. A large project with complex contribution guidelines may even break this file down into a directory structure within the repo and provide links to specific topics from this file ([see Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/main/doc/contributing)).

A non-exhaustive list of things you might want to include (or link out to):
 - How to contact the project's maintainers
 - Links to channels where the project might be discussed (GitHub discussions within the repo, Stack Overflow, Discord, IRC, etc.)
 - How to install the project and develop locally
 - How and when to file GitHub issues
 - Best practices and rules for initiating pull requests
 - Description of the pull request review process
 - Branch policies within the repo
 - Code style and documentation guidelines
 - Descriptions of any automation that exists in the repo
 - Documentation procedures
    - Changelog
    - API endpoints
    - Releases/Versioning
 - Testing guidelines
 - Debugging/troubleshooting instructions
